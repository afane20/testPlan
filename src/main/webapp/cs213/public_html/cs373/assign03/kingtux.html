      Some of my hobbies:
    </p>

    I'm a fond student of languages, history, and culture. I've learned
    some spanish, japanese, mandarin, hebrew and german (in order of
    familiarity), but have yet to get fluent with any of them. However, I
    can read most nontechnical spanish and also comprehend it, I just can't
    really respond in a reasonable amount of time without thinking about it
    harder than I should. Japanese is also up there, as I can understand
    most of what a 1st or 2nd grader might know, and then a little.
    However, it has the benefit in that I learned it the right way and I
    don't need to think about it. 

    <br/><br/>
    As for history, I started out with a strict interest in European 
    history, but I have since replaced it with Asian, which is really strange 
    for me (I never thought that I'd ever be interested in japanese, or even 
    mandarin for that matter). Usually, I'm fairly predictable if you've known 
    me for an extended period of time, and this is one area where I can't 
    explain how I got interested, or anyone else that knows me well. 

    <br/><br/>
    Those are the only gimmes that you're going to get from here. If you 
    really want to know more about my interests, then just talk to me some time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style = "font-weight: bold">
      Some of my interests/time-wasters: 
    </p>
    My "pet projects", which I usually keep about 5 or 6 or more around at
    once. I never complete them all, but I still manage to think up more
    all the time and forget about others.  
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style = "font-weight: bold">
      Areas of computer science I like the most:
    </p>
    Software engineering, operating systems, and computational theory.
    Basically, I like doing things that if done right the user will never
    notice, but will have the biggest impact.  
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style = "font-weight: bold">
      Areas of computer science that I hate the most:
    </p>
    Web Development. I've done extensive HTML and javascript before
    (Started with HTML 3 then worked into HTML 4), but I can't stand them.
    To me, it seems like a very demeaning programming task that any script
    kiddy can do for minimum wage. Also, I hate how Microsoft doesn't do
    things the way the standards specify, which makes it a pain to build in
    exceptions for things that should work perfectly fine if they weren't
    trying to force everyone to do things in a very broken manner.
    Alongside that, I also don't like web development because it imposes
    certain limits on you as a programmer and makes me feel like I'm just
    playing around in the kid's pool of software development, when I could
    be doing some serious programming instead. Anyways, that's my little
    rant on web development.

      Everyone here probably has heard of this one, and, just like about everyone else, I like the articles,
      but I read it for the comments. If I want to see computer science related articles, I've got better 
      sources which usually give me the news faster (anywhere from a few hours faster to a week faster), 
      and in more detail.

      Reuters is one of the main sources for all news media, with AP being another source. You usually can 
      catch breaking news the fastest here and likely will see some stories that just don't get as much 
      media attention.
