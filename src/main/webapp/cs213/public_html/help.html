            <td>
               After completeing an assignment submit your home work by typing "submit " than the files name.  For example if you had a file named HelloWorld.cpp then you would submit it by typeing "submit HelloWorld.cpp".  Make sure you have the correct header in you file.

            <td class="subject">Test Beds</td>
            <td>
               When you run your program against the test bed with the command given to you by your instructor, there is a chance that your output won't match exactly with what's expected.  The test bed points these differences out with a 'v' above the difference with an example of what the output should look like below your output.  If the output matches, you'll get a "No errors" message after all of the tests.  Congratulations.

            <td class="subject">Style Checker <pre>(sc program.cpp)</pre></td>
            <td>
               The style checker reads through your program and checks your spelling, indentations, comments, and other such things to do with the style of your program.  Some of the common questions that we get with this have to do with what each section means.  The headers for sections are pretty straight forward.  If one of your functions (ex. main) is missing a comment block, then you'll get an error for missing a comment block.  If one of your lines is too long, you'll get an error for a line exceeding 80 characters.

            <td class="subject">Interpreting compiler error messages</td>
            <td>
               Compiler error messages are, for the most part, easy to read.  The line that tells what the problem is will have the program name followed by a number (ex. program.cpp:13: error:...).  The rest of the line describes the problem.  Some problems, though, may only appear during runtime (e.g. segmentation fault).
